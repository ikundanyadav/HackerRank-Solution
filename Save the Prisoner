#A jail has a number of prisoners and a number of treats to pass out to them. Their jailer decides the fairest way to divide the treats 
#is to seat the prisoners around a circular table in sequentially numbered chairs. A chair number will be drawn from a hat. 
#Beginning with the prisoner in that chair, one candy will be handed to each prisoner sequentially around the table until all have been 
#distributed.
